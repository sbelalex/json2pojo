# json2pojo

This program can take any number of files containing JSON and convert them to Java objects (POJOs).

Just load up the /input/ folder with some .json or .txt files, and run it. Your POJOs will be in the /output/ folder.

At the top of PojoGenerator.java, you may change the annotation type between Gson or Jackson.

Enjoy!
